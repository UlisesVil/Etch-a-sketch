# Etch a Sketch

This application is fully responsive, and its purpose is to draw pixel art style.

The application has two modes:

The rainbow mode, which allows the user to fill the grid with random colors.

The drawing mode, which allows the user to draw whatever he can imagine.

To start in the Drawing Mode, we must adjust the grid with the first section on the left and write the desired number of frames.

For example, if we write the number ten, we will have a 10x10 grid, the size of the canvas will not change, and the squares will adjust the size.

The users will be able to draw what they wanted.

Fifty pictures are available, from which they can choose with the arrows in the change image section above the selected image. They can navigate forward and backward to choose one and take it as a guide.

Below the image, there is a color picker to change color and draw with the selected color.

The user can save their drawing in PNG format at any time with the Save Sketch button.

The Reset initial button will return to the initial state with the 16x16 grid and erase what the user did to that moment.
